#
#  Ansible Playbook to run https://github.com/outrunnl/dbcollect
#  on a group of Oracle DB servers
#
#  Usage: ansible-playbook -i hosts dbcollect.yml [-e "var=value ..."]
#
#  Author: Bruno Fl√ºckiger <bruno@bsdhowto.ch>
#  Co-Author: Niels Herren
#  Date: 2021-11-03
#
#  Version: 1.2
#  Changes (Bart Sjerps, 2024-02-05):
#  - python -> python3
#  - added parameters
#  - changed target path from /bin to /usr/local/bin
#  - added temp_path & temp dir for temp files
#  - parameters now must be provided on the cmdline: -e 'parameters="-o -d 1"'
#  Version: 1.3
#  Changes (Bart Sjerps, 2025-05-01):
#  - Abort if any of the hosts fail
#  - Run dbcollect check on all hosts before actually collecting data
#  - Download dbcollect directly from github link (no more download.py script)
#  - Download dbcollect is done on localhost and copied to servers (so db hosts
#    no longer need https connectivity)
#  - Default parameter "-o" (overwrite) to avoid unnecessary failures
#
#  Note that Ansible no longer works on old platforms (EL6)
