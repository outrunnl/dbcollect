            "Solution:\n\nThe AWR files are stored without stripped SQL code. You may not want this. Inspect the ZIP file to make sure.\n" \
            "It is also possible that the AWR file(s) are corrupted or not created correctly (invalid HTML but no AWR report at all). If this happens with one or a few files, it is safe to ignore. If it happens with lots of files, report the error. "
